# Macro Meets Microchips
Over the past decade, AI has become one of the hottest sectors in the world. Companies are investing large amounts into AI infrastructure, which has created a large demand for NVIDIA products. As companies integrate more AI into their infrastructure, we expect them to replace certain jobs. Our hypothesis is that the increase in demand for NVIDIA products will lead to higher US unemployment. I am also planning to use the S&P 500 as a benchmark to measure the overall economy’s health to help with noise.
